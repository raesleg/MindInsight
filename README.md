Mental health is one of the biggest challenges in Singapore right now, and misdiagnosis in mental health is not uncommon, especially regarding more severe mental disorders. This is due to a few factors such as overlapping symptoms, lack of clinical experience in psychiatrists and even patients who are unwilling to talk openly or have trouble sharing their thoughts and emotions. 
The solution: AI to act as a notetaker during sessions, giving mental healthcare professionals feedback about clients through their body language and emotions. Mental healthcare professionals will be able to look at the analysis and understand the clients better through the supervision of AI as they may miss out on some points during the session. They can then make informed decisions, more accurate diagnoses, and understand which topics were sensitive or their trigger points during therapy sessions.
